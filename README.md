# Team-Profile-Generator-with-Tests
This application takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

## Design

* When a user starts the application, they're prompted to enter the team manager's: Name; Employee ID; Email address; Office number;
* When a user enters those requirements, the user is presented with a menu with the option to: Add an engineer; Add an intern or Finish building the team; 
* When a user selects the engineer option, the user is prompted to enter the following and then taken back to the menu: Engineer's Name; ID; Email; GitHub username
* When a user selects the intern option, the user is prompted to enter the following and then taken back to the menu: Internâ€™s name; ID; Email; School
* When a user decides to finish building their team, they exit the application and the HTML is generated.
